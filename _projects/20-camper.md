#The Camper Project

<img src="/assets/camper/camper_cad.jpg" alt= "CAD Model of Camper">

## The Beginning
After COVID19 evacuated me from the Peace Corps, I spent the following season working a covid friendly job and supporting trails in my hometown.
At the same time, my family was getting rid of our old pop-up camper, which I promptly snatched up. Can't get rid of it that easily! (cue hoarding tendencies)

Before pictures:

### The Teardown

My plan was to freshen up the pop-up camper and maybe live in it for the summer.

I started tearing down the pieces that didn't look so good...
{% include gallery id="gallery2" %}

### The New Plan

The old camper looked terrible, so I tore it down to its bones and repainted the frame.
John Deere Green, ohhhh yeahhhh.

{% include gallery id="gallery3" %}

## The Frame

- I started constructing the frame with 2x1" rectangular steel tubing.
- Using 2" thick "studs" was a mistake, as I later learned that 1.5" thick walls is common and popular for RVs and campers.
- I kerf-cut the steel members in order to bend them into my desired shape.

### The Floor

I attached an aluminum underbelly and a wooden subfloor to the trailer, with room for insulation.
The propane lines would later be installed in-between these layers.
