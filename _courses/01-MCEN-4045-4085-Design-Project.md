MCEN 4045 focused on developing a design proposal and constructing a prototype, while MCEN 4085 focused on completing the design and delivering results.

My team conducted a feasibility study on the use of rotating pendulum vibration absorbers (RPVAs) to counteract peak torsional vibrations within the crankshaft of an aviation engine. 
We used both project management and technical skills to organize literature reviews, define problems based on customer information, develop and validate vibration simulations, and recommend decisions for the client.

## Contribution
My contribution focused on the construction of an accurate torsional vibration model, verified by  real-time observational data. 
Our team successfully delivered a prediction of potential amplitude reduction if a 4th-order RPVA was utilized in the engine.
The successful implementation of an RPVA requires careful and advanced engineering techniques. Alongside other business and sourcing difficulties, the client ultimately pursued the [development of a brand-new V-twin aviation engine](/portfolio/spiritengineering)
