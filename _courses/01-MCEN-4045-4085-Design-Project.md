title: MCEN 4045 & MCEN 4085 - Design Project I & II
---
A two-semester comprehensive capstone design experience carried out by a team of three. 
My team conducted a feasibility study on using pendulum absorbers to counteract peak torsional vibrations within the crankshaft of an aviation engine. 

MCEN 4045 focused on developing a design proposal and constructing a prototype, while MCEN 4085 focused on completing the design and delivering results.
My team used project management skills to organize literature reviews, define problems based on customer information, develop and validate vibration simulations, and recommend decisions for the client.
