## Course Objectives 

Aerospace Environment is a core course in the RSESS focus area, meant to introduce you to the near-Earth
space environment and its effects on spacecraft, communications systems, astronauts, and more. Aerospace
engineers working on space technology or applications need a broad understanding of the environment in
order to design their spacecraft appropriately.
