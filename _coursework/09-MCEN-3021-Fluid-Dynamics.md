## Course Objectives 

The overall aims of this course is to (i) formulate mechanical-engineering fluids problems in mathematical terms by employing the appropriate balances and/or correlations, (ii) to solve the resulting equations using an appropriate solution method, and (iii) to analyze experimental and theoretical results in both a qualitative and quantitative manner.
