Spirit Engineering is a new aviation company developing novel LSA engines & airframes using top-down manufacturing approaches and carefully tuned production methods.

I am not under NDA, but out of respect for my former employer, I will withhold sharing details of the project until it has been formally unveiled.  If you have professional or job-related inquiries, please [contact me](https://www.ross.thefischers.me/contact).

## Test Cell Operation

I oversaw and maintained almost all aspects of our in-house test cell. 
Our prototype engine was equipped with a variety of high-speed sensors:
- Rotary Encoders & Tachometers
- Pressure Transducers,
- RTDs/Thermocouples
- Dynamometer
- Variable Frequency Drives, etc
  
Signals were acquired via a National Instruments DAQ, and pre-processed through Combustion Analysis software

## Test Engineering

I often planned, conducted, and reported results of tests. A few tests I was involved with are:
- Carburetor Tuning & Air/Fuel Ratio Optimizing
- Enging Timing Optimizing
- Altitude Performance 
- Vibration Dampening Puck Performance 
- Oil System Sizing
- Tribology of Wear Components 
- Airframe Rigidity
  
Many of these tests resulted in design changes for the sake of optimal performance or manufacturability.
Many tests also required custom tooling and equipment to be developed. Altitude testing, for example, required the quick development of a PID-controlled/pressure-feedback roots blower in order to pressurize the inlet air to a given altitude.

## Data Specialist

During test cell operation, I was responsible for taking short "snapshots" of engine operation.
I initally improved on the overall data pipeline by automating the uploading of data files to our local server. I also developed a script using Python to automate the data conversion process, providing intelligble data files to be further analyzed. This automation reduced processing time by more than x5, allowing for more indepth tests to be conducted.

Notable, I developed a simple thermodynamic stability model in order to estimate the heat rejection ability of the engine heads.

My team regularly met to discuss theoretical and fundamental problems, whereupon I verified or refuted our hypothesis by analyzing and visualizing the data.

## Development Engineering

At Spirit, I held a wide range of other responsibilities including but not limited to:
- Quality assurance and measurement of new and old parts, using in-house inspection tools and methods
- Engineering drawing preparation & review, in accordance with ASME Y14.5
- CAD use (Creo Parametric and Fusion 360) to modify 3d models and construct assemblies
- Basic work with finite element analysis, 
- Drawing workflow and configuration engineering
- Development Inventory control document creation 
- Component preliminary and critical design reviews
- Vendor communication (both technical and sourcing)
