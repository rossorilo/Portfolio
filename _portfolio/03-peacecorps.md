Far from the comforts of home, serving in Peace Corps helped shape a well-rounded and informed worldview. I learned to recognize the power of collective efforts when implementing change. It also built personal resilience when placed in unfamiliar situations.

## Project Management

Peace Corps members are provided the opportunity to collaborate with their host communities and write grants that will benefit them. Funded by USAID or other humanitarian organizations, these grants allow members and their communities to plan and implement sustainable and impactful projects.

### Well Drilling

Funded by USAID, I wrote and implemented a grant to provide clean water on the school campus. The school no longer had to rely on student labor to provide water for lunch, cleaning, and washing clothes. With the help of school administrators and parents, we organized an in-kind community contribution of materials and labor.

### Student Conferences

I implemented a grant-funded student conference in Ndana town promoting science education. 
Select students engaged in:
- hands-on experiments,
- critical thinking sessions,
- STEM based competitions.

See Concept Memo here: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQsoZs2zMcKvb3729ZY4PBUdpq8bNgOe/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101522129468829840944&rtpof=true&sd=true)

I also brought students to other member's various conferences: life skills, leadership, and another STEM conference.

### Huru Project

From [Huru International](https://www.huruinternational.org/):

> Every month, girls across Africa are forced to miss school because they lack access to safe, sustainable menstrual products and experience the shame and embarrassment associated with menstruation. Too often, girls fall behind in school and ultimately drop out.

I applied with the help of Madam Batuli, see the application here: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sIj5cmGqJ5ndx5tQnPi7vkGtRnEfxDXX/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101522129468829840944&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Together, we:
- distributed surveys,
- attended HURU trainings,
- shared menstrual and sex education with students,
- organized transport and distribution of menstrual pad kits to every female student at Namajani Day Secondary School.

## Science Education

Members in the education sector are placed at Secondary Schools across the country for two years. We organize teaching schedules according to the school's needs and our skills. 

I taught the school's physics curriculum for 2 years (often in the Swahili Language) following the national syllabus, and prepared students for standardized tests. During my tenure, I introduced a group of students to Junior and Senior level physics which had never been taught in the history of Namajani Day S.S..
