During the Summer of 2017 I acted as a research assistant to the Chief Scientist of the International Arctic Research Center, [Dr. John Walsh](https://uaf-iarc.org/?directory_entry=john-walsh).

Dr. John Walsh and his colleagues provided background knowledge and datasets used to address the question:

> What drives surface moisture variations in the Arctic and, ultimately, the trend towards a wetter or drier Arctic landscape? 



## Climate Data Processing

I processed large amounts of in-situ measurements collected from intensive observatories Across Alaska. 

{% include feature_row id="row1" %}

The data included various channels:
- Evapotranspiration (eddy covariance measurements of the latent heat flux)
- Precipitation
- Radiative heat fluxes
- Ground heat fluxes
- Relative humidity
- Wind speed

{% include feature_row id="row2" %}


## Data Analysis and Model Validation

I used Python to perform  statistical analysis on both in-situ and climate model output data. 

I showed the primary drivers of ET were air temperature and relative humidity. 


By comparing the correlations of the drivers of in-situ data with those from the model, I revealed that the model's hydrologic cycle was over-simulated, leading to excessive precipitation and evapotranspiration.

The bias at some locations was a factor of two or more, pointing to serious deficiencies in the model formulation.

## Paper Authorship and Poster Presentation

These results led to a refereed publication in Atmosphere and Climate Sciences, of which I was the lead author.

I presented a poster on the results at the American Geophysical Union conference, 2017, New Orleans.
